# SMARTALK
The Knowledge Sharing Hub

## Problem statement
Even though we consider Education as the most significant part of Human's life, not everyone in our society is lucky enough to get good teachers or get admissions in good schools. As obvious as it seems, our school's syllabus focuses on theoretical knowledge and skill-development and practical-knowledge is overlooked.

We might be living in the world of smart-phones, but our education system doesn't seems smart enough to reach everyone and in every field. There always remains a gap between those who are experts in their fields voluntarily willing to enlighten others and those who are looking for an opportunity to learn.



## THE IDEA ðŸ’¡
Our motive is to bridge the gap between the experts and the eager learners. We plan to make smart-education accessible to one-and-all, with people having first-hand experience.

There are a lot of educators, and experts who are willing to impart their knowledge, but do not actually have a platform or even a reason to do so.
We provide such volunteers with the opportunity to share their wisdom among those less fortunate.

## How it Works ðŸ”„
Such volunteers register their talk/lecture proposal at our portal. We validate it on the basis of their qualification to teach the corresponding subject. Once Validated, All the proposals are live under the TALKS section.

Now viewers(including students or officials of NGOs) may see all the Talk-Proposals with the details of the respective speakers. If they are willing to attend a particular Talk, they can ask their organisation to host the talk at their premises. Now the organisation needs to fill in their details and it'll be sent to the speaker.

The speaker will then contact the organisers and mutually decide a date and time for the talk to take place.


## Target Audience

Though our primary target is to help out **NGOs** to find educators and organise educational sessions for those deprived of resources.
We are also open to have organisers from **schools** and **colleges**.
